# MapFuse
MapFuse is a solution to build complete, volumetric models of an environment. The environment has to be recorded with a Microsoft Kinect camera, to create a dataset which can be used for the RGB-D SLAM algorithm. The output of this algorithm is combined with an initial model of the environment in order to build a complete model.
